# urbanmove-etl-pipeline
This project implements a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipeline for UrbanMove, a hypothetical transport analytics platform. It automates the ingestion of raw trip data from ClickHouse, performs cleaning and weather-data enrichment outside the database using Python/Pandas, and loads the final analytics-ready dataset into PostgreSQL.
